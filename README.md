## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **License and SDK**
   - Contact us at <contact@id3.eu> to obtain:
     - License activation key
     - SDK ZIP archive

2. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure you have the required development tools for your chosen language:
     - Android: Android Studio 2020+
     - C++: CMake >= 2.8.12, GCC (Linux) or Visual Studio >= 15 (Windows)
     - .NET: Microsoft Visual Studio 2017+
     - Flutter: Flutter SDK
     - Java: Java environment with java and javac tools
     - Python: Python 3.9-3.11 (Windows) or appropriate version (Linux)
     - Swift: Xcode (iOS)

### Installation

1. **SDK Setup**
   - Unzip the SDK archive to the `sdk/` subfolder:
   ```
   .
   â”œâ”€â”€ sdk/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ activation/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bin/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
   ```

2. **Models Setup**
   - Download required models from the SDK documentation
   - Place models in the `models/` directory:
   ```
   .
   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ eye_gaze_estimator_v2a.id3nn
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ eye_openness_detector_v1a.id3nn
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ face_pose_estimator_v1a.id3nn
   ```
   - Note: Not all models are required - check each sample's README for specific requirements

### License Activation

The id3 Face SDK requires a valid license file. You can activate your license using one of the following methods:

#### Mobile Systems (Android/iOS)
```kotlin
// Example for Android in Kotlin
val hardwareCode = FaceLicense.getHostHardwareCode(LicenseHardwareCodeType.ANDROID)
val licenseBuffer = FaceLicense.activateActivationKeyBuffer(
    hardwareCode, 
    "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "Activated from Android"
)
```

#### Windows/Linux Systems
- **Command Line Interface** (in `sdk/activation/cli-tool/`):
  ```bash
  # Windows example
  .\id3LicenseActivationCLI.exe --activate .\id3Face.lic \
      --activationkey="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
  ```

- **API Activation** (example in C#):
  ```csharp
  string hardwareCode = FaceLicense.GetHostHardwareCode(LicenseHardwareCodeType.WindowsOs);
  FaceLicense.ActivateActivationKey(
      hardwareCode,
      "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
      "Activated through C# API",
      "id3Face.lic"
  );
  ```

#### Windows License Manager (Alternative Method)

If you're on Windows, you can also use the License Manager tool located in `sdk/activation/windows-tool/` to manage your license. Save the license file in the root of the samples directory as `id3Face.lic`.

### Running Your First Sample

1. **Choose a Sample**
   - Browse the [Sample Projects Overview](#sample-projects-overview) below
   - Select a sample that matches your target platform and language

2. **Follow the Sample's README**
   - Each sample has its own README with specific setup instructions
   - Follow the build and run steps carefully

3. **Explore the Code**
   - All samples are heavily commented to help you understand the SDK usage
   - We recommend reading through the code while running the samples
